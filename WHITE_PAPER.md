🛡️ Executive Summary: Project Cognitive Shield
Date: February 14, 2026

Status: Open Source (AGPLv3)

Target: Strategic Partnership / Institutional Support

1. The Problem: The Infocalypse
In the current digital landscape, the speed of information often bypasses human critical thinking. High-intensity emotional priming, logical fallacies, and cognitive manipulation are used to erode public discourse and individual agency. Current AI solutions focus on what to think (fact-checking), rather than how to think (logic-checking), often leading to accusations of bias or censorship.

2. The Solution: Cognitive Shield
Cognitive Shield is a privacy-first, decentralized framework designed to empower users by identifying the mechanisms of manipulation in real-time. Instead of judging the truthfulness of a claim, it analyzes the logical structure and emotional load of the content.

Core Pillars:
Logic-over-Content: Identifies formal and informal fallacies (Ad Hominem, Straw Man, etc.).

Privacy-by-Design: Analysis is intended to be performed locally (Edge Computing), ensuring user data never leaves the device.

Neutralization: Provides users with objective re-phrasing of emotionally charged content to restore cognitive balance.

3. Technical Implementation
The project is built on an open-source JSON-based logic engine (fallacies.json), allowing for rapid multi-language localization and community-driven expansion.

Current Phase: MVP with localized bilingual support (EN/BG).

Next Milestone: Integration of lightweight NLP models (e.g., HuggingFace Transformers) for context-aware fallacy detection.

4. Why Mozilla Foundation?
Cognitive Shield aligns perfectly with the Mozilla Manifesto, specifically:

Principle 4: Individuals’ security and privacy on the internet are fundamental and must not be treated as optional.

Principle 7: Free and open-source software promotes the development of the internet as a public resource.

We are seeking mentorship and alignment with Mozilla’s "Responsible AI" initiatives to scale this from a community project to a standard digital infrastructure for a healthier internet.

5. Roadmap 2026
Q1-Q2: Community building and Browser Extension (Alpha).

Q3: Integration of On-device LLM analysis.

Q4: Public launch and institutional outreach for global education.
## Technical Architecture: Phase 2 (Roadmap 2026)

### 1. Decentralized Multi-Agent System (MAS)
We are moving from a single detection script to a **Consensus Engine**. 
* **Analyst Agents:** Specialized LLMs (Llama/Mistral) identify fallacies.
* **Adversarial Agent:** Challenges findings to reduce false positives.
* **Synthesizer:** Outputs the final "Traffic Light" score based on agent agreement.

### 2. Blockchain Reputation & Funding Layer
To ensure the Shield remains censorship-resistant, we utilize a Decentralized Ledger:
* **Proof of Logic:** Hash-logging of fallacy detections to prevent "Shadow Editing" of truth.
* **Follow-the-Money API:** Integration with public transparency databases to flag source interests.
* **Community Governance:** AGPLv3 contributors can vote on logic-rule updates via the reputation protocol.
