BLUEPRINT: PROJECT "COGNITIVE SHIELD"
Version: 1.2 (January 2026) | Status: Conceptual Framework for Strategic Partner Transfer

1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY (The Core Idea)
"Cognitive Shield" is a decentralized, open-source system that acts as an intelligent arbiter of information. The objective is not censorship, but the cultivation of user immunity against logical fallacies, populism, and hybrid attacks in real-time through a visual indicator (traffic-light system).

2. TECHNICAL AND ETHICAL PILLARS
The project is built upon three core innovations:

Triangulation Protocol: Instead of relying on a single "source of truth," the system seeks consensus between official data, independent fact-checkers, and a blockchain-based registry.

Blockchain Reputation Ledger: A transparent and immutable record of the historical accuracy and reliability of every information source.

Rhetorical Fallacy Detection: Leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) to identify methods of manipulation (e.g., ad hominem, strawman arguments, emotional priming) rather than judging the underlying opinion itself.

3. STRATEGIC MODEL: DENMARK – BULGARIA
The project capitalizes on a unique geopolitical contrast within the EU:

Denmark (Institutional Root): Utilizing the Danish model of social trust and ethics to establish the administrative and ethical headquarters.

Bulgaria (R&D and Stress-Test): Leveraging Bulgarian technical talent and the specific environment of intensive hybrid warfare to calibrate and stress-test the algorithms.

4. IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY (The Pivot)
Rather than establishing a new corporation, the project is offered as an Open-Source initiative or a module for existing NGOs/Institutions.

Target Organizations for Partnership:

Tech Foundations: Mozilla Foundation, Luminate.

Academic Centers: Digital Democracy Centre (Denmark), ETH Zurich (Ethics Lab).

Counter-Disinformation Institutions: EDMO (EU), CSD (Bulgaria).

5. ETHICAL CODE
Transparency: Full visibility of the source code and the logic behind decision-making processes.

Privacy: Data processing occurs on the local device (Edge Computing) to ensure user anonymity.

Neutrality: A strict focus on how something is being said (methodology) rather than who is saying it (identity).
