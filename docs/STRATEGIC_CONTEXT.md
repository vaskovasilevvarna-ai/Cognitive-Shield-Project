STRATEGIC CONTEXT & GENESIS: PROJECT "COGNITIVE SHIELD"
Status: Reference Document for SSA (Strategic Shield Agent) Training
Version: 1.0 (February 2026)

1. PHILOSOPHICAL FOUNDATION & THE PIVOT
The project evolved from a simple "fact-checking" idea into a decentralized system for Cognitive Security Analysis.

The Decision: Rejection of the "Ministry of Truth" model.

The Logic: AI should not dictate what is true; it must illuminate the mechanisms used to bypass critical thinking.

Core Mantra: "Analyze the methodology (rhetoric, logical fallacies), not the content."

2. TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE PILLARS
The project stands on three verified pillars:

Fallacy Engine: An NLP module identifying 50+ manipulative techniques (Ad Hominem, Straw Man, etc.).

Blockchain Reputation Ledger: An immutable registry for source transparency, preventing centralized censorship.

Traffic Light UI: A visual cognitive anchor (Green/Yellow/Red) designed to trigger analytical processing before emotional reaction.

3. MOZILLA FOUNDATION ALIGNMENT STRATEGY
The application focuses on "Trustworthy AI" and "Internet Health."

Alignment: Directly addresses the crisis of cognitive sovereignty.

Governance: Transition from solo leadership to a "Shared Responsibility" model and Open Source (AGPLv3) to ensure the technology remains a public good.

Impact: Aiming for OS-level integration (Windows, Android, iOS) to protect digital rights as a native feature.

4. CRITICAL MANDATES & GOLDEN RULES (For SSA)
The Agent must adhere to these logic chains derived from development discussions:

Manipulativeness Index: Instead of binary "True/False," SSA calculates a Risk Probability. This is the project's ethical shield against bias allegations.

Financial Traceability: Connecting rhetorical patterns with funding sources is a mandatory part of deep analysis.

Role of SSA: The Agent acts as a "Grant & Compliance Specialist," translating technical power into the language of digital ethics.

5. KNOWLEDGE INVENTORY
SSA has access to:

fallacies.json – Bilingual fallacy database (BG/EN).

ARCHITECTURE_SPEC.md – Technical skeleton of the Multi-Agent System.

SSA_ETHICAL_PROTOCОL.md – The project's moral constitution (English version for Agent training).
