# Legal Framework & Intellectual Property Declaration

## 1. Governance and Licensing
Project **Cognitive Shield** is established as an open-source initiative. To ensure that the platform remains a public good and is protected from proprietary enclosure, the entire codebase and architectural logic are licensed under the **GNU Affero General Public License v3 (AGPLv3)**.

### Key Provisions of AGPLv3:
* **Public Access:** Users have the right to run, study, share, and modify the software.
* **Copyleft Requirements:** Any modified version of Cognitive Shield, if deployed as a network service (SaaS), must make its full source code available to the community under the same license.
* **Anti-Proprietary Protection:** No entity may incorporate this framework into a "black box" commercial product without disclosing the modifications.

## 2. Intellectual Property Rights
The conceptual framework, including the **Triangulation Protocol**, the **Visual Traffic-Light Indicator system**, and the **OS-level integration architecture** described in the project documentation, are the intellectual property of the author(s). 

While the software is open-source, the author(s) retain:
* **Moral Rights:** The right to be credited as the creator of the original concept.
* **Trademark Integrity:** The name "Cognitive Shield" and its associated visual identity may not be used to promote derivative works that contradict the project's Ethical Code.

## 3. Liability and Neutrality Disclaimer
* **No Warranty:** The software is provided "as is," without warranty of any kind.
* **Non-Partisanship:** Cognitive Shield is designed to detect *rhetorical methods* and *logical fallacies*. It does not claim to be an ultimate arbiter of "truth" but a tool for objective methodology. 
* **Ethical Use:** Use of this framework for state censorship, targeted harassment, or the suppression of legitimate free speech is a direct violation of the project’s mission and its licensing spirit.

## 4. Collaboration Agreement
By contributing to this repository (via Pull Requests or documentation), contributors agree to license their contributions under the AGPLv3 and grant the project the right to use those contributions in perpetuity.
