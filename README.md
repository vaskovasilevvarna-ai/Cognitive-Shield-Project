## 🌐 Vision
In an era of algorithmic manipulation, **Cognitive Shield** empowers citizens to protect their cognitive sovereignty. We move beyond simple fact-checking to **Logic-Checking**, exposing the mechanisms of manipulation through a transparent, decentralized, and privacy-first ecosystem.

## 🚥 The Traffic Light Integrity System (UI/UX)
We simplify complex AI analysis into intuitive signals for the everyday user:
* 🟢 **GREEN:** High logical integrity. Verified source.
* 🟡 **YELLOW:** Heuristic alert. Emotional priming or minor fallacies detected.
* 🔴 **RED:** High manipulation risk. Structural fallacies and biased source.

## 🛠️ Advanced Architecture (Roadmap 2026)

| Module | Technology | Objective |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **🤖 Multi-Agent Consensus** | **MAS Pipeline** | Eliminates single-model bias through decentralized AI deliberation. |
| **⛓️ Blockchain Ledger** | **Immutable Audit** | Provides an unchangeable history of logical rules and reputation. |
| **💰 Money-Trace API** | **Transparency Engine** | Flags source funding (political/corporate) to reveal underlying interests. |
| **🛡️ Privacy-First** | **Edge Computing** | All initial processing happens locally on the user's device. |
