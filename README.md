# Cognitive-Shield-Project
Decentralized open-source framework for real-time cognitive defense and fallacy detection."
# Cognitive Shield 🛡️
**The immune system for the digital age.**

## 🎯 Vision
Cognitive Shield is an open-source, decentralized layer for the internet designed to protect users from manipulation, logical fallacies, and emotional priming in real-time.

## ⚖️ Ethical Charter
1. **Neutrality:** Focus on *how* something is said, not *who* says it.
2. **Transparency:** All detection logic is open for public audit.
3. **Privacy:** Analysis happens locally on the user's device (Edge Computing).

## 🛠 Tech Stack (Planned)
- Python / Transformers (NLP)
- AGPL-3.0 License
- Decentralized Reputation Ledger (Blockchain)

## 📜 Licensing
This project is licensed under the **AGPLv3**. Any service using this code over a network MUST remain open-source.
## 🚀 Key Features

### 🚥 Traffic Light Integrity System
Our UI provides instant cognitive signaling:
* 🟢 **Green:** High logical integrity; verified source reputation.
* 🟡 **Yellow:** Presence of emotional priming or minor fallacies. Caution advised.
* 🔴 **Red:** High manipulation risk; multiple logical fallacies detected.

### 💰 Funding & Source Transparency
The Shield doesn't just analyze *what* is said, but *who* is paying for it.
* **Source Disclosure:** Real-time lookup of publisher funding (political/corporate).
* **Reputation Ledger:** Blockchain-backed history of source reliability.

### 🤖 Multi-Agent Consensus (MAS)
Leveraging multiple AI agents to deliberate on content, eliminating individual model bias and ensuring a "Democratic" output.
